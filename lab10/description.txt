The algorithm used works in the following way:
1. Parses the input data given in text format
2. Fuzzifies data
3. Does inference on data
4. Defuzzifies data
5. Computes the weighted average of computed data (SUGENO)
6. Outputs the result

The Sugeno model used by this solution  computes the crisp function depending on inputs.
Using a model of degree 1, f(x, y) = ax + by + c
